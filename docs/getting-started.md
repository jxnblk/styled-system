# Getting Started

```sh
npm i styled-system
```

Styled system works with many CSS-in-JS libraries, such as
[styled-components][sc], [glamorous][glamorous], [emotion][emotion], and [fela][fela].
These libraries use functional styles based on props and allow defining themes with a ThemeProvider.
Styled system uses these conventions to provide responsive theme-based style props for React UI components.

The docs use styled-components for examples, but usage should be similar for any other CSS-in-JS library.
